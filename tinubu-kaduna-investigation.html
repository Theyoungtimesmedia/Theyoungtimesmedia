                <p>Striking resident doctors in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) have challenged FCT Minister Nyesom Wike and Senate President Godswill Akpabio to use government hospitals in the nation’s capital to feel the plight of public health workers and patients.

                    “If we are ready to fix the healthcare system in this country, I would think that every government official must use the government hospitals. Let’s start with that,” George Ebong said on Channels Television’s Politics Today programme on Wednesday.
                    
                    “I would like to see the minister use Wuse General Hospital. I would like to see the Senate President use Maitama General Hospital. I would like to see the Speaker use Iyanya General Hospital. Then, we can start to fix the system. If they don’t use it, then we can’t fix it. I’m sorry but that’s the truth.”The doctors began a three-day warning strike on Wednesday over unpaid salaries, and allowances, among others after the expiration of a three-week ultimatum issued earlier. The development grounded activities at government hospitals in Abuja from Wuse to Asokoro, Maitama, Kubwa, Zuba, Kwali, Abaji, Nyanya, and others.Ebong, the President of resident doctors in the FCT, accused Wike and other government officials of neglecting health facilities and workers’ welfare in Abuja.

                    He said though Wike has been busy fixing roads, he has abandoned health institutions in the nation’s capital with many in deplorable condition.
                    
                    “That’s just where we have our concerns. The minister has been very busy with projects, fixing roads, and all of that. We feel that he should also focus on the hospitals right now.
                    
                    “We feel that we are the human abandoned project. No matter the things he does by fixing roads and bridges, the hospitals are the very first point of innovation and rehabilitation. They are hallowed ground; he cannot neglect them,” he said.

                    Ebong said, “For example, we don’t have electricity, sometimes you can’t run some tests over the weekend, we don’t have drugs, we don’t have scan machines working, and we don’t have enough manpower.” He said only one doctor man some hospitals in Abuja.Indefinite Strike Looms
                    Ebong said many doctors have not been paid their six months’ salaries despite working assiduously and taking on the responsibilities of four or more persons.
                    
                    “When he (Wike) first became the minister that was the only time we’ve met him but we’ve met everyone that works under him. We’ve sent him a series of letters and I am sure he is aware,” Ebong said.
                    
                    He blamed the so-called bottlenecks in the system that have not allowed things to be done properly.
                    
                    “I urge the minister to please try to ensure that all the wages are paid. I urge the minister to please visit all the ministers and see the state in which the hospitals are at the moment,” he said.
                    
                    Ebong said the association would reassess the situation after the warning strike and if the congress felt nothing was done, “the congress will not have a choice than to go on a timeless shut down”.</p>
